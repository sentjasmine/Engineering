    <h2>Diary of a wannabe engineer</h2>
    <p>September 02, 2022- Today was a challenge day; we had to make a home applience so I decided to make a baking mixer. I enjoyed CAD'ing but forming the metalic mixing part of the mixer was particularly difficult. The class before today's we learned a little about mechanical engineering which was nice because I am considering being either a mechanica or aerospace engineer. I'm excited to start our Rube Goldberg machine next week.</a></p>
    
    <p>September 16, 2022- Today my groupmates and I built a boat to float on water out of paper. We combined a triangle top with two flipped over paper air planes. It did not work that well but we realize now that we should have had a larger surface area.</p>
