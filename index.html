   <h2><center>Diary of a Wannabe Engineer</center></h2>

<p>September 02, 2022- Today was a challenge day; we had to make a home applience so I decided to make a baking mixer. I enjoyed CAD'ing but forming the metalic mixing part of the mixer was particularly difficult. The class before today's we learned a little about mechanical engineering which was nice because I am considering being either a mechanical or aerospace engineer. I'm excited to start our Rube Goldberg machine next week.</a></p>
    
<p>September 16, 2022- Today my groupmates and I built a boat to float on water out of paper. We combined a triangle top with two flipped over paper air planes. It did not work that well but we realize now that we should have had a larger surface area.</p>
    
<p>September 22, 2022- We got to test our Rube Goldberg machine in class. The balloon did not pop the first few times and we concluded that the needle that we were using was very weak and not sharp enough to pierce through the balloon. We solved this problem by using a thicker and pointy-er needle. And it worked! All in all I had a lot of fun builing and designing this project.</p>

<p>September 30, 2022- In class this week we dissected a computer. In other words we reverse engineered this super old and masive school computer in our table groups. We had to remove parts like the CPU, GPU, fan, CD player and much more. The goal way to get all the way down to just the motherboard but we were not able to because some of the screws were too small and tight to take out. Nevertheless I enjoyed taking apart the computer(not so much putting it back) and would definitely do it again.</p>

<p>October 07, 2022- This week the class worked on making prosthetics for animals. I was absent so I missed it however I heard that the activity was on tinker cad and people had creative ideas on inovating prosthetics. Today we had to create instructios on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We read the instructions to the class and repeated the actions words for word. The purpose of this excersise was to teach us that computers need every little description to print code.</p>

<p>October 13, 2022- Today isn't a Friday but because we are going to have a guest speaker tommorrow I figured I would complete my entery today. We moved into a new unit this week... Aerospace engineering! For our project we are to build a rocket made of a 2 liter soda bottle that will launch in the air after the water pressure that fills it gets too high. My groupmates and I have completed the CAD for our design and researching things that will make our rocket more effective and aerodynamic.</p>

<p>October 21, 2022- Today we launched our rockets and it was very successful. Our rocket launched high into the air before falling and then accelerating again towards the end. Our payload however did not work the way we had hoped; we think it was because it was attached to the wrong side of the rocket and that it was on too tight but other than that it worked really well.</p>

<p>October 28, 2022- I was not at school this week because I had so many college application deadlines coming up. I heard from my groupmates that they filtered out water with rocks which sounded pretty cool.</p>

<p>November 04, 2022- Today I was not in class because I went with my robotics team to represent myteam and robot that we built during season. We explained our robot functions to kids and adults alike but also got the chance to see innovative robot avatars being created right now. It was a great experiance.</p>

<p>November 10, 2022- This week we learned about electrical engineering. We CAD'ed breadboards the first day and then the second day we made the irl. It was a bit frustrating getting the LED to light up, especially multiple at a time but it was very accomplishing when we did.</p>

<p>November 18, 2022- We continued with our electrical engineering lesson; programming more complicated circuits. This time we programmed them in the language that they came in. It was similar to the work I do in Computer Science class with Mr.Poole so I am pretty sure it was java. Nevertheless, I was intrgued to see java being used to actually program something rather than in our labs in class</p>

<p>December 02, 2022- Coming back from winter break it was a pretty light week. We were taught a bit about our new section civil engineering and introduced to our final project. We later watched world cup which was nice.</p>

<p>December 09, 2022- We started planning our final project, a spagetti bridge. We are to build a bridge out of long spagetti that is two feet length and it is supposed to support a bucket of water hanging beneath it. Sounds like a lot so we started to CAD it out first.</p>

<p>December 16, 2022- This week we worked on building and testing our first designs. A lot of the other groups' projects that I watched worked really well, which is contrary to what I thought considering that spagetti was an interesting choice of materials to say the least. My group however was unable to test any of our designs because of setbacks such as our bridge breaking our it getting glued stuck to the cardboard we were using as a base.</p>

<p>December 23, 2022- We were finally able to test our bridges today and they did not go as planned I learned from other more efficient groups and how they made their bridge design</p>

<p>January 18, 2023- Today we went over chemical engineering which is a lot more complex than I thought. Last week we learned about buisness engineering and did a mini project which involved us drafting and idea for a product and doing a presentaion on the issues it solves.</p>

<p>March 07, 2023- For the past 6 weeks or so our class has been working on a long term project. My partner Laleh and I chose to build a mousetrap car because it closely relates to the type of work required for our intended majors. I had build a mousetrap car in 8th grade before but it failed so I was determined to get it right this time. We started the first week by writing out our plan, making a BOM and CAD as well. We then did research on other mousetrap cars that others have done in the past, mechanics of cars in general and listed our options for materials. We originally planned to focus on making our car as lightweight as possible by building the frames out of rulers. But other than the car being light, there were really no other benefits to this plan and would have made placement for the other aspects of the car very difficult. We ended up settling for a carboard chassis/ frame with three wheels. Each wheel was doubles up for stability. We chose three wheels because in our research there was a mousetrap car that worked better with the three wheels rather than four. The most challeneging part of our build process was getting the wheels to spin in the direction we wanted it without blocking the wheels path of movement. The string did not have any slack and was usually tied either too tight, or in opposite directions cancelling out the acceleration entirely. We fixed this by adding a string that would do the pulling and increase the potential energy. If I were given more time, I would have made the stick that was attached to the string longer to allow more length for the string which would ultimately increase the distance the car can go. In the end, our car was successul and can now say that I have redeemed myself from failing the project 5 years ago. All in all, I really enjoyed buildinging the car.</p>
