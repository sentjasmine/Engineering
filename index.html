    <h2>Diary of a wannabe engineer</h2>
    <p>September 02, 2022- Today was a challenge day; we had to make a home applience so I decided to make a baking mixer. I enjoyed CAD'ing but forming the metalic mixing part of the mixer was particularly difficult. The class before today's we learned a little about mechanical engineering which was nice because I am considering being either a mechanica or aerospace engineer. I'm excited to start our Rube Goldberg machine next week.</a></p>
    
    <p>September 16, 2022- Today my groupmates and I built a boat to float on water out of paper. We combined a triangle top with two flipped over paper air planes. It did not work that well but we realize now that we should have had a larger surface area.</p>
    
    <p>September 22, 2022- We got to test our Rube Goldberg machine in class. The balloon did not pop the first few times and we concluded that the needle that we were using was very weak and not sharp enough to pierce through the balloon. We solved this problem by using a thicker and pointy-er needle. And it worked! All in all I had a lot of fun builing and designing this project.</p>

   <p>September 30, 2022- In class this week we dissected a computer. In other words we reverse engineered this super old and masive school computer in our table groups. We had to remove parts like the CPU, GPU, fan, CD player and much more. The goal way to get all the way down to just the motherboard but we were not able to because some of the screws were too small and tight to take out. Nevertheless I enjoyed taking apart the computer(not so much putting it back) and would definitely do it again.</p>

<p>October 07, 2022- This week the class worked on making prosthetics for animals. I was absent so I missed it however I heard that the activity was on tinker cad and people had creative ideas on inovating prosthetics. Today we had to create instructios on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We read the instructions to the class and repeated the actions words for word. The purpose of this excersise was to teach us that computers need every little description to print code.</p>
