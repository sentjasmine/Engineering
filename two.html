<p>January 18, 2023- Today we went over chemical engineering which is a lot more complex than I thought. Last week we learned about buisness engineering and did a mini project which involved us drafting and idea for a product and doing a presentaion on the issues it solves.</p>

<h4><center>Mouse Trap Car Chronicles</center></h4>

<p>March 07, 2023- For the past 6 weeks or so our class has been working on a long term project. My partner Laleh and I chose to build a mousetrap car because it closely relates to the type of work required for our intended majors. I had build a mousetrap car in 8th grade before but it failed so I was determined to get it right this time. We started the first week by writing out our plan, making a BOM and CAD as well. We then did research on other mousetrap cars that others have done in the past, mechanics of cars in general and listed our options for materials. We originally planned to focus on making our car as lightweight as possible by building the frames out of rulers. But other than the car being light, there were really no other benefits to this plan and would have made placement for the other aspects of the car very difficult. We ended up settling for a carboard chassis/ frame with three wheels. Each wheel was doubles up for stability. We chose three wheels because in our research there was a mousetrap car that worked better with the three wheels rather than four. The most challeneging part of our build process was getting the wheels to spin in the direction we wanted it without blocking the wheels path of movement. The string did not have any slack and was usually tied either too tight, or in opposite directions cancelling out the acceleration entirely. We fixed this by adding a string that would do the pulling and increase the potential energy. If I were given more time, I would have made the stick that was attached to the string longer to allow more length for the string which would ultimately increase the distance the car can go. In the end, our car was successul and can now say that I have redeemed myself from failing the project 5 years ago. All in all, I really enjoyed buildinging the car.</p>

<h4><center>Egg Drop Entry</center></h4>
    
<p>March 20, 2023- The past few weeks we have been working on an egg drop project. We were tasked to drop an egg from the third floor of the 1000 building. We had a few designs that we were working on but we settled with </p>

<h4><center>Cardboard Final</center></h4>

<p>April 03, 2023- We have been recently introduced to our final project for this class where we are to build a carboard boat that should carry two group members(the lighter the better so I've been nominated) to get across the room and get this: we can only use cardboard and ONE role of duct taoe. Being premature engineers who dont want to drown in our high school swimming pool, we emailed our old physics teacher for help on boyancy. She never responded. So we preceded to figure it out on our own and after a week of board drawing and pescering every STEM related teacher we had in our schedule we came up with the conclusion that to make our boat bouyant we must have VERY high walls.</p>

<p>April 10, 2023- I would like to say that because we had a general idea of our boat design that we began building but the truth is, this week was caotic. I was stressed out about AP exams so I used the time to study and sort of give my input on what shpuld be done. Laleh masacred pieces of carboard with a box cutter while ALbany panicked that she was going to accidentaly cut herself. Amira and Alabany also worked on the CAD which was c=nice though we are yet to actually design something that looks exactly like out CAD. One minor milestone however was that I came up with the brilliant idea that we should make a smaller version of our boat with all our designs and test it to see if it worked, everyone in both classes stole that idea and ironically ours did not work that well when we went to test it out in the pool. I almsot lost my eraser that day. In conclusion we have taken one step forward and like four steps back.</p>

<p>April 17, 2023 - Because of our subpar test trial of our boats last week I was glad that we switched it up this week and worked on a Friday Engineering Challenge. We were supposed to make a bridge using 20 post-its and try to make it as long as possible. The urge to have the longest bridge in class motivated out group enough to cut the pieces small enough and place them just right to make it as efficient as possible. Needless to say we won&#128580;</p>

<p>April 21-28, 2023 - This week we set out to lacerate the thickest pieces of carboard as possible. We figure since the boat is made of cardboard that is easily disintegradable when it comes in contact with water, we need to have as much cardboard at the bottom as possible. So we spent the last two weeks cutting the dimensions of the cardboard out. </p>

<p>May 05, 2023 - This week was the start of AP week. Because of this we were locked in the classroom with 36 teenage boys. Dispite the inevitable headache we all had to endure that week, we managed to make progress with the walls of our boat as well as deciding to have a ramp that we will use to ease our boat into the pool.</p>

<p>May 11, 2023 - This week was the second andlast week of AP testing week as well as the week leading up to prom. Because of this and senior ditch day I did not come to class at all. My group mates however went once and were able to tape together the entire boat and basically finish it. But allas, the boat was too big to fit though the door and dismantelled at the attempt. We lost half our roll of tape and were now a week behind. One the bright side, we went to prom on Saturday so here's a picture of all of us together...</p>

<p>May 20- 2023 - Because of the series of unfortunate events that was last week, we were behind and had to do a lot of work to catch up. It was all worth it though because we were able to finish and we are now ready to test next week. </p>
